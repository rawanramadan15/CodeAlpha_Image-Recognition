This is an image style transfer project, which copies the style features os an image to implement
them on another image; creating a new visually-stunning image with a specific selected style.
The approach of implementing such a project is to combine the technical computational techniques with the artistic concepts
It takes the advantages of the capabilities of deep neural networks to automate the transformation
of images; resulting in a seamless fusion of content images and style images across various visual contexts
